    "    A high bias model makes strong assumptions about the data, leading to underfitting.高偏差模型对数据做出强烈的假设，导致拟合不足。\n",
    "    It can’t capture the true complexity of the underlying relationship它无法捕捉潜在关系的真正复杂性。\n",
    "    To Decrease Bias:\n",
    "        One way to reduce bias is to run multiple training processes starting from different randomly chosen initial weights (e.g., 20 or more attempts). This increases the chance of reaching a better local minimum.\n",
    "        Another approach is to increase the number of neurons in the hidden layer, which allows the model to better capture the complexity of the problem.\n",
    "            However, there is a trade-off: adding too many neurons can lead to high variance and overparameterization, causing the model to overfit添加过多的神经元会导致高方差和过度参数化，导致模型过度拟合。\n",
    "3.5.4.2.Overfitting过拟合\n",
    "    A model is considered overparameterized when it has more trainable parameters than the available training data can uniquely determine.\n",
    "    In simpler terms, the model has too many parameters relative to the size or complexity of the dataset.\n",
    "    As a result, it becomes powerful enough to memorize记住 the training data (including noise) rather than learning the underlying general patterns\n",
    "    The neural network is trained by presenting it with the input and target values for all items in the training set\n",
    "    After completing the learning procedure, it must then predict the outputs for items in the test set\n",
    "    The goal is to accurately predict the target values for the test set based on the input attributes.\n",
    "    A common mistake to avoid is building a model that fits the training data very well but performs poorly on unseen test data—this problem is known as overfitting.过度拟合\n",
    "    In contrast, a model that achieves high accuracy on both the training and test sets is said to have good generalization概括性\n",
    "    To determine the optimal model parameters, the dataset is often divided into Training, Validation, and Test (generalization) sets为了确定最佳模型参数，数据集通常分为训练集、验证集和测试（泛化）集。\n",
    "    Typically, as the number of hidden nodes increases, both the training and test errors initially decrease.\n",
    "    However, beyond a certain point, the training error may continue to decrease while the test error plateaus or even slightly increases. The approximate number of hidden nodes at which the test error is minimal is likely to achieve the best generalization performance测试误差最小的隐藏节点的近似数量可能会实现最佳的泛化性能\n",
    "3.5.4.3.Conclusion:\n",
    "    Increasing the number of neurons can help reduce bias (underfitting), while limiting the number of neurons helps prevent overfitting (high variance). This balance reflects the well-known bias–variance trade-off.增加神经元数量有助于减少偏差（欠拟合），而限制神经元数量有助于防止过度拟合（高方差）。这种平衡反映了众所周知的偏差-方差权衡。\n",

    "    If we denote the first layer as 𝑓 1 , the second layer is 𝑓 2 , and so on. The total number of layers defines the depth深度 of the model, which is why this approach is known as deep learning深度学习\n",
    "3.6.1.depth\n",
    "    The depth of a model is defined as the total number of layers with learnable parameters, excluding theinput layer.不包括输入层\n",
    "    Deeper networks can typically approximate more complex functions, while shallower models have fewer layers and are limited to approximating simpler functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is based on the philosophy of connectionism:连接主义\n",
    "    while an individual biological neuron is not particularly intelligent, a large population of neurons or features acting together can exhibit intelligent behavior\n",
    "    It is important to emphasize that the number of neurons must be large.神经元的数量必须很大\n",
    "    One of the key factors behind the dramatic improvement in neural network accuracy and the complexity of tasks they can handle—from the 1980s to today—is the significant increase in network size\n",
    "\n",
    "    Deep learning refers to artificial neural networks with multiple layers that automatically learn\n",
    "patterns and representations from data\n",
    "    What makes a network “deep” is the presence of many layers of neurons, not just one or two. A shallow network浅层网络 might have only a single hidden layer, whereas a deep network深度网络 can have hundreds or even thousands of layers\n",

    "            but it is still shallow深度较低 \n",
    "            computationally inefficient and does not capture hierarchical representations effectively (low precision)\n",

    "            This network is extremely deep but very narrow.非常深，但非常狭窄\n",
    "            It qualifies as deep learning深度学习 because the depth (number of layers) is enormous.\n",
    "            However, with only one neuron per layer, the network’s expressive power is limited"
