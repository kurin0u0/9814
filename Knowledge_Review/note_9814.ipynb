    "    A high bias model makes strong assumptions about the data, leading to underfitting.高偏差模型对数据做出强烈的假设，导致拟合不足。\n",
    "    It can’t capture the true complexity of the underlying relationship它无法捕捉潜在关系的真正复杂性。\n",
    "    To Decrease Bias:\n",
    "        One way to reduce bias is to run multiple training processes starting from different randomly chosen initial weights (e.g., 20 or more attempts). This increases the chance of reaching a better local minimum.\n",
    "        Another approach is to increase the number of neurons in the hidden layer, which allows the model to better capture the complexity of the problem.\n",
    "            However, there is a trade-off: adding too many neurons can lead to high variance and overparameterization, causing the model to overfit添加过多的神经元会导致高方差和过度参数化，导致模型过度拟合。\n",
    "3.5.4.2.Overfitting过拟合\n",
    "    A model is considered overparameterized when it has more trainable parameters than the available training data can uniquely determine.\n",
    "    In simpler terms, the model has too many parameters relative to the size or complexity of the dataset.\n",
    "    As a result, it becomes powerful enough to memorize记住 the training data (including noise) rather than learning the underlying general patterns\n",
    "    The neural network is trained by presenting it with the input and target values for all items in the training set\n",
    "    After completing the learning procedure, it must then predict the outputs for items in the test set\n",
    "    The goal is to accurately predict the target values for the test set based on the input attributes.\n",
    "    A common mistake to avoid is building a model that fits the training data very well but performs poorly on unseen test data—this problem is known as overfitting.过度拟合\n",
    "    In contrast, a model that achieves high accuracy on both the training and test sets is said to have good generalization概括性\n",
    "    To determine the optimal model parameters, the dataset is often divided into Training, Validation, and Test (generalization) sets为了确定最佳模型参数，数据集通常分为训练集、验证集和测试（泛化）集。\n",
    "    Typically, as the number of hidden nodes increases, both the training and test errors initially decrease.\n",
    "    However, beyond a certain point, the training error may continue to decrease while the test error plateaus or even slightly increases. The approximate number of hidden nodes at which the test error is minimal is likely to achieve the best generalization performance测试误差最小的隐藏节点的近似数量可能会实现最佳的泛化性能\n",
    "3.5.4.3.Conclusion:\n",
    "    Increasing the number of neurons can help reduce bias (underfitting), while limiting the number of neurons helps prevent overfitting (high variance). This balance reflects the well-known bias–variance trade-off.增加神经元数量有助于减少偏差（欠拟合），而限制神经元数量有助于防止过度拟合（高方差）。这种平衡反映了众所周知的偏差-方差权衡。\n",

    "    In many AI systems, perception is treated as a black box that just turns raw imagesbinto labels.\n",
    "    The system uses mostly static data (like images or single video frames) and doesn’t really \"understand\" .\n",
    "    Moving from raw pixel data to high-level symbolic understanding 高级符号理解 is not easy.\n",
    "    There’s often no causal link —system doesn’t understand why things happen 不理解事情发生的原因, or how the present relates to the past.\n",
    "    Because of this, such systems struggle to anticipate the future 很难预测未来.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.3.2.Vision and Reasoning Interaction 视觉与推理交互\n",
    "    Cognitive vision instead of just extracting features (like edges or shapes), it aims to understand and reason 理解和推理 about what’s happening in the scene\n",
    "    The system predicts 预测 what it expects to see or sense.\n",
    "    Then it explores 探索 to check if its predictions are correct.\n",
    "    This prediction–exploration loop 预测-探索循环 helps the system go from just labeling things to truly interacting with and learning about the world, like humans do.\n",
    "    So, cognitive vision 认知视觉 is about combining perception with reasoning, learning, and action 感知与推理、学习和行动, enabling systems to adapt, anticipate the future, and deal with uncertainty.\n",
    "    Cognitive vision to support human-robot interaction.\n",
    "    iCub’s behavior driven only by the direction of the subject’s gaze making explicit intention to reach for the left or right hand.\n",
    "    Cognitive Vision: Vision and Reasoning Interaction\n",
    "    Cognitive vision can be used for signature of biological motion.\n",
    "    Angular velocity and curvature of the trajectory are features that CV systems might analyze to identify biological motions.\n",
    "    Hand during drawing or writing.\n",
    "    Knee or ankle during walking.\n",
    "    Visually measured independently of its shape and color.\n",
    "    Cognitive Vision is not just about identifying \"what 是什么\" is in the scene and \"where 在哪里\" it is.\n",
    "    Most current vision systems treat perception as a standalone task—独立的任务 just detect and classify. Cognitive vision challenges 挑战 this narrow view.\n",
    "    Cognitive vision combines V and R to drive action 结合视觉和感知来驱动行动. It's a multi-modal system多模态系统 —vision works together with other senses and cognitive functions.\n",
